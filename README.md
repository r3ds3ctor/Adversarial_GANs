# Adversarial_GANs
A Python-based Reinforcement Learning system for generating and mutating payloads to evade detection systems.

## Overview

This project implements an adversarial RL agent that applies aggressive mutations to payloads, optimizing them through feedback from detection systems. The system uses Reinforcement Learning to learn which mutation techniques are most effective for evasion.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Agent** with Q-learning
- **Multiple Mutation Techniques** (Base64 encoding, variable renaming, syntax changes, etc.)
- **VirusTotal Integration** for real detection feedback
- **Automatic Payload Evolution** through generations
- **Detailed Analysis** of payload structure and entropy

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/r3ds3ctor/Adversarial_GANs.git
cd Adversarial_GANs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
- Prepare your payloads in payloads.txt:
```
your_original_payload_here
another_payload_example
```
- Run the evolution process:
```
python R_adversarial_lab.py

```
